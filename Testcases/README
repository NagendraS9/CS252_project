replace the files client-phaseX.cpp with your files. Also replace the makefile with your own.

EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT MAKING SUBMISSION FOR A PARTICULAR PHASE, MAKE SURE THAT YOU STILL SUBMIT A FILE FOR THAT PHASE WITH EMPTY int main() 
AND YOUR MAKEFILE COMPILES THAT. 
MAKEFILE SHOULD GENERATE 5 EXECUTABLES NAMED client-phaseX for X 1..5

Syntax for running: ./run.sh <path-to-testcase> <number-of-clients> <phase>
for eg: ./run.sh ./tc5_0 5 3
this will store your output in a folder called output

the folder sol5_0 contains files ans_x_y which is the expected output of client x on phase y

use diff with -Bw option to check if your output is correct
